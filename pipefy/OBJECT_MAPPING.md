# Pipefy to Tallyfy Object Mapping Guide

## Terminology Translation

This guide provides comprehensive mapping between Pipefy and Tallyfy concepts, helping users understand the fundamental paradigm shift from Kanban-based to Sequential Process workflows.

## Core Object Mappings

### Organizations
| Pipefy | Tallyfy | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Organization | Organization | Direct mapping |
| Company | Organization | Tallyfy uses flat structure |
| Teams | Groups | User collections |

### Template Objects
| Pipefy | Tallyfy | API Name | Notes |

## Paradigm Shift: Kanban to Sequential

### The Fundamental Difference

**Pipefy**: Cards move through phases on a Kanban board
**Tallyfy**: Tasks complete in sequence within a process

This isn't just a terminology change - it's a complete shift in how work flows:

| Pipefy Concept | Tallyfy Implementation | Impact |
|----------------|------------------------|--------|
| Card moves between phases | Tasks complete in order | Linear progression |
| Multiple cards in a phase | Sequential task execution | No parallel cards |
| Visual board view | Timeline/checklist view | Different visualization |
| Drag-and-drop movement | Click to complete | Different interaction |
| Phase-based SLAs | Task deadlines | Granular timing |

### Phase to Step Transformation

Each Pipefy phase becomes THREE Tallyfy steps:

```
Pipefy Phase: "Review Documents"
‚Üì
Tallyfy Steps:
1. "Review Documents - Entry" (Notification step)
2. "Review Documents - Work" (Actual task)
3. "Review Documents - Exit" (Completion check)
```

## Field Type Mappings

| Pipefy Field | Tallyfy Capture Type | Data Transformation |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Short Text | Short Text | Direct mapping |
| Long Text | Long Text | Direct mapping |
| Number | Number | Direct mapping |
| Date | Date | Direct mapping |
| DateTime | Date | Time may be lost |
| Dropdown Select | Dropdown | Options preserved |
| Radio Select | Radio Buttons | Direct mapping |
| Checkbox Select | Checklist | Multi-select |
| Email | Short Text + Validation | Add validation |
| Phone | Short Text + Validation | Format validation |
| Currency | Number | Remove currency symbol |
| Assignee Select | Assignee Picker | User selection |
| Label Select | Tags | Metadata |
| Connection Field | Short Text | Store reference |
| Statement | Long Text (readonly) | Instructional text |
| Time | Short Text | Store as HH:MM |
| CNPJ/CPF | Short Text + Validation | Brazilian ID validation |

## Workflow Elements

| Pipefy | Tallyfy | Implementation |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| Phase Sequence | Step Order | Linear progression |
| Card Movement | Task Completion | Status change |
| SLA per Phase | Task Deadlines | Individual timing |
| Conditionals | IF-THEN Rules | Logic recreation |
| Automations | Webhooks + Rules | Combined approach |
| Email Templates | Email Tasks | Rebuilt templates |
| Recurrence | External Scheduling | Use automation tools |
| Public Forms | Kick-off Forms | Limited public access |

## Database Tables (Critical Limitation)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è No Direct Equivalent in Tallyfy

Pipefy's database tables have NO direct equivalent in Tallyfy. Migration strategy:

1. **Export to PostgreSQL**: Tables migrated to external database
2. **API Wrapper**: Build custom API for table access
3. **Integration**: Connect via webhooks/API calls
4. **Data Loss Risk**: Complex table relationships may break

| Pipefy Database Feature | Workaround | Complexity |
|------------------------|------------|------------|
| Table Records | PostgreSQL + API | High |
| Table Relationships | Foreign Keys in DB | High |
| Table Fields | Database Columns | Medium |
| Table Connections | API Integration | Very High |
| Record Cards | Separate Processes | Medium |

## Automation Features

| Pipefy | Tallyfy | Migration Approach |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| Move Card Automation | Complete Task Rule | Different trigger |
| Create Card Automation | Launch Process | Via webhook |
| Update Field Automation | Update Field Rule | Recreate logic |
| Send Email Automation | Email Task | Manual rebuild |
| Conditionals | IF-THEN Rules | Complex recreation |
| SLA Automation | Deadline Notifications | Built-in feature |
| Alert Automation | Notifications | Configure new |
| Integration Automation | Webhooks | Reconnect services |

## Feature Comparison

### ‚úÖ Fully Supported Migrations
- User accounts and profiles
- Basic pipe structure (as sequential process)
- Field data and values
- Comments and activity
- File attachments (< 100MB)

- Advanced reporting dashboards

## Migration Strategies

### Simple Pipes (< 5 phases, no databases)
- Direct transformation possible
- 2-4 hours per pipe
- Minimal data loss

### Complex Pipes (> 5 phases with conditionals)
- Phased migration approach
- Test extensively in sandbox
- 1-2 days per pipe
- Some feature recreation needed

### Database-Heavy Pipes
- **Critical Planning Required**
- Set up PostgreSQL first
- Build API wrapper
- Test data integrity
- 3-5 days per pipe
- Significant technical work

### Active Cards Migration
- Complete urgent cards in Pipefy first
- Migrate at phase boundaries
- Run parallel for validation
- Gradual cutover recommended

## Post-Migration Validation

### Required Checks
1. All users can access ‚úì
2. Process flow matches intent ‚úì
3. Data fields preserved ‚úì
4. Automations recreated ‚úì
5. Database connections work ‚úì
6. Files accessible ‚úì

### Common Adjustments
1. Retrain users on sequential flow
2. Rebuild complex automations
3. Set up database API endpoints
4. Configure new integrations
5. Adjust deadline strategies
6. Create new reports

## GraphQL to REST API Mapping

| Operation | Pipefy GraphQL | Tallyfy REST |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| List Templates | `query { pipes }` | `GET /blueprints` |
| Get Template | `query { pipe(id) }` | `GET /blueprints/{id}` |
| List Cards | `query { cards }` | `GET /runs` |
| Get Card | `query { card(id) }` | `GET /runs/{id}` |
| Create Card | `mutation { createCard }` | `POST /runs` |
| Update Card | `mutation { updateCard }` | `PUT /runs/{id}` |
| Move Card | `mutation { moveCard }` | `PUT /tasks/{id}` |

## Critical Migration Warnings

### üö® Paradigm Shift Impact
Users MUST understand that Pipefy's Kanban model fundamentally differs from Tallyfy's sequential process model. This isn't just a UI change - it changes how work flows through the system.

### üö® Database Tables
If your Pipefy implementation heavily uses database tables:
1. Migration complexity increases 10x
2. Requires technical database expertise
3. May need custom development
4. Consider if migration is worth the effort

### üö® Training Required
Users accustomed to dragging cards between phases will need significant retraining for Tallyfy's task-completion model.
