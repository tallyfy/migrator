Determine optimal batch size for migrating Pipefy cards via GraphQL.

Migration context:
- Total cards to migrate: {total_cards}
- Current complexity points: {complexity_points}
- Max complexity per query: {max_complexity}
- Rate limit remaining: {rate_limit_remaining}
- Average fields per card: {avg_fields}

Calculate batch size that:
- Stays within GraphQL complexity limits
- Maximizes efficiency
- Avoids rate limiting
- Ensures reliable processing

Respond with JSON:

  "batch_size": N,
  "estimated_batches": N,
  "estimated_time_minutes": N,
