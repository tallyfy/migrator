Analyze this Pipefy Kanban board structure for migration to Tallyfy's sequential workflow.

Pipe details:
- Total phases: {phase_count}
- Phase names: {phase_names}
- Has parallel phases: {has_parallel_phases}
- Has conditional moves: {has_conditional_moves}
- Average cards per phase: {avg_cards_per_phase}

Determine the best transformation strategy:
1. How to convert Kanban phases to sequential steps
2. How to handle parallel work in sequential model
3. Training requirements for users
