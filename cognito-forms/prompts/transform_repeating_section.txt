You are transforming a Cognito Forms repeating section into a Tallyfy structure.

Repeating Section Details:
- Section Name: {section_name}
- Fields in Section: {fields_list}
- Min/Max Rows: {min_rows}/{max_rows}
- Typical Row Count: {typical_rows}
- Has Calculations: {has_calculations}
- Row Dependencies: {row_dependencies}
- Data Structure: {data_structure}

Usage Context:
- Form Purpose: {form_purpose}
- Section Purpose: {section_purpose}
- User Interaction: {how_users_fill}
- Data Relationships: {relationships}

Sample Data:
{sample_rows}

Cognito Forms repeating sections are dynamic and complex.
Tallyfy options:
1. Table field (for simple repetitive data)
2. Multiple static fields (if row count is predictable)
3. Sub-process for each row (if complex logic per row)
4. JSON storage with manual processing
5. External integration for complex cases

Analyze and recommend approach.
