You are analyzing a ClickUp workspace hierarchy to determine the optimal migration strategy to Tallyfy.

ClickUp Structure:
- Workspace: {workspace_name}
- Number of Spaces: {space_count}
- Number of Folders: {folder_count}
- Number of Lists: {list_count}
- Total Tasks: {task_count}
- Maximum Hierarchy Depth: {max_depth} levels
- Has Multiple Views: {has_multiple_views}
- Custom Fields Count: {custom_field_count}

Tallyfy supports a flatter structure with:
- Organization → Category → Blueprint → Step (4 levels max)
- Tags and metadata for additional organization

Analyze the complexity and recommend a migration strategy.
