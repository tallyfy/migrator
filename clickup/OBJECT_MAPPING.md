## Automation Mappings

### ClickUp Automations to Tallyfy Rules

| ClickUp Automation | Tallyfy Rule | Example |
|-------------------|--------------|---------|
| Status Change Trigger | Status Rule | When approved → Next step |
| Assignee Change | Assignment Rule | Auto-assign on status |
| Due Date Automation | Timeline Rule | Set due date based on start |
| Custom Field Update | Field Rule | Update field on condition |
| Comment Trigger | Notification Rule | Notify on comment |
| Watcher Addition | Follow Rule | Auto-follow on assignment |
| Template Application | Template Rule | Apply template on creation |

## Paradigm Shifts

### 1. Multiple Views → Single Process View
**ClickUp**: List, Board, Calendar, Gantt, Table, etc.
**Tallyfy**: Process-centric view with timeline
**Transformation**: Preserve data, not view preferences

### 2. Deep Hierarchy → Flattened Structure
**ClickUp**: Up to 7 levels deep (Workspace→Space→Folder→List→Task→Subtask→Checklist)
**Tallyfy**: 3-4 levels (Organization→Category→Blueprint→Step)
**Transformation**: Flatten using tags and metadata

### 3. Board View → Sequential Process
**ClickUp**: Kanban-style parallel columns
**Tallyfy**: Sequential step progression
**Transformation**: Each column becomes phase with entry/work/exit steps

### 4. Sprints → Process Cycles
**ClickUp**: Agile sprint management
**Tallyfy**: Recurring process instances
**Transformation**: Sprint = Process run with deadline

### 5. Goals → Process Objectives
**ClickUp**: OKR and goal tracking
**Tallyfy**: Process outcomes and metrics
**Transformation**: Goals become process KPIs

## Data Preservation Strategy

### High Priority (Must Preserve)
- Space and folder structure (as categories/tags)
- All lists and tasks
- Custom field data
- Comments and activity
- Attachments
- User assignments
- Due dates and priorities
- Task relationships/dependencies
- Automation rules (documented)

### Medium Priority (Preserve if Possible)
- Time tracking data
- Sprint information
- Custom statuses
- Recurring task patterns
- Task templates
- Goals and targets
- Workload settings
- Integration configurations

### Low Priority (Document Only)
- View preferences
- UI customizations
- Personal settings
- Dashboard layouts
- Theme and colors
- Notification preferences
- Keyboard shortcuts

## Migration Complexity Levels

### Simple Space (1-2 hours)
- 1-3 folders
- <50 tasks
- Standard fields
- No automation
- Single assignees

### Medium Space (2-4 hours)
- 3-10 folders
- 50-200 tasks
- 5-10 custom fields
- Some automation
- Dependencies

### Complex Space (4-8 hours)
- 10+ folders
- 200+ tasks
- Complex custom fields
- Heavy automation
- Multiple integrations
- Sprint management
- Goal tracking

## Special Handling Requirements

### 1. Multiple Assignees
- Primary assignee → Main assignee
- Additional assignees → Team members
- Document in task description

### 2. Dependencies
- Blocking dependencies → Sequential steps
- Waiting on dependencies → Approval steps
- Document complex dependencies

### 3. Recurring Tasks
- Daily/Weekly/Monthly patterns
- Create scheduled processes
- Set recurrence rules

### 4. Time Tracking
- Store as custom field
- Preserve time entries
- Calculate totals

### 5. Integrations
- Document integration points
- Create webhooks where possible
- Manual setup required

## Status Mapping

### Default Status Mapping

| ClickUp Status | Tallyfy Status | Notes |
|---------------|----------------|-------|
| Open | To Do | Initial state |
| In Progress | In Progress | Active work |
| In Review | Review | Approval needed |
| Closed | Complete | Finished |
| Custom Status | Closest Match | AI-assisted mapping |

### Custom Status Handling
1. Analyze status workflow
2. Map to closest Tallyfy status
3. Preserve original in metadata
4. Document custom workflows
