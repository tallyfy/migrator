You are transforming Basecamp 3's Hill Chart progress tracking into Tallyfy's progress system.

Hill Chart Details:
- Project Name: {project_name}
- Scopes on Hill: {scopes_list}
- Current Positions: {scope_positions}
- Update History: {position_history}

Scope Details:
{scopes_detail}

Hill Chart Concept:
- Left side (uphill): Problem-solving, figuring things out, unknown work
- Top of hill: Solution found, approach clear
- Right side (downhill): Execution, implementation, known work

Current Status:
- Scopes Uphill: {uphill_count}
- Scopes at Peak: {peak_count}
- Scopes Downhill: {downhill_count}
- Scopes Complete: {complete_count}

Tallyfy doesn't have hill charts but has progress tracking and status indicators.
