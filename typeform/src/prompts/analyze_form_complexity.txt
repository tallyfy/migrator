Analyze this Typeform structure and determine the optimal migration strategy to Tallyfy.

Form details:
- Form title: {form_title}
- Total fields: {field_count}
- Field types breakdown: {field_types}
- Has logic jumps: {has_logic}
- Logic complexity: {logic_complexity} (simple/moderate/complex)
- Has sections/groups: {has_groups}
- Has calculations/variables: {has_calculations}
- File upload fields: {file_upload_count}
- Average field complexity: {avg_complexity}

Field distribution:
{field_distribution}

Determine the best strategy:
1. "single_kickoff" - Keep as single kick-off form (â‰¤20 fields, simple logic)
2. "multi_step_simple" - Split into 2-3 steps (21-40 fields)
3. "multi_step_moderate" - Split into 3-5 steps (41-60 fields)
4. "complex_workflow" - Complex multi-step workflow (>60 fields or complex logic)

Consider:
- User cognitive load (too many fields overwhelm users)
- Logical grouping of related fields (contact info, preferences, etc.)
- Natural break points in the form flow
- Logic jump patterns that suggest step boundaries
- Optimal fields per step (10-15 ideal, max 20)
