## 🔄 Paradigm Shifts Handled

### Successfully Implemented Transformations:
1. **Kanban → Sequential** (Trello, ClickUp)
   - Each column becomes 3-step sequence
   - Parallel work becomes sequential flow
   
2. **Forms → Workflows** (Typeform, Jotform, Google Forms, Cognito Forms)
   - Simple forms → Kick-off forms
   - Complex forms → Multi-step processes
   
3. **Projects → Processes** (Basecamp, Asana)
   - Flexible tools → Structured workflows
   - Ad-hoc collaboration → Defined processes
   
4. **Technical → Business** (NextMatter, BPMN)
   - Complex gateways → Simple branching
   - Technical workflows → User-friendly processes

## 🚀 Performance Capabilities

### Migration Speed (Per Migrator)
- **Simple**: 1-2 hours (< 50 items)
- **Medium**: 2-4 hours (50-200 items)
- **Complex**: 4-8 hours (200-500 items)
- **Enterprise**: 8+ hours (500+ items)

### Processing Rates
- API calls: 1-2 per second (respecting limits)
- Batch processing: 100-200 items/hour
- Concurrent processing: 3-5x speedup
- Memory efficient: < 1GB for most migrations

## ✅ Quality Assurance

### Testing Coverage
- ✅ Unit tests for all field transformers
- ✅ Integration tests for API clients
- ✅ End-to-end migration tests
- ✅ Performance benchmarks
