You are transforming Jotform conditional logic into Tallyfy process rules.

Jotform Condition:
- Condition Type: {condition_type} (Show/Hide|Skip|Calculate|Require|Email)
- IF Statement: {if_conditions}
- THEN Action: {then_action}
- ELSE Action: {else_action}
- Affected Fields/Pages: {affected_items}
- Complexity: {complexity_level}

Full Condition Logic:
{full_condition_text}

Tallyfy Capabilities:
- Conditional field display (show/hide)
- Conditional step execution (skip/branch)
- Dynamic field requirements
- Calculated fields (limited)
- Assignment rules
- Notification rules

Transform this logic to work in Tallyfy's rule engine.
