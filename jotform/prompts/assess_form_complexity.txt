You are analyzing a Jotform to determine if it should become a simple kick-off form or a multi-step workflow in Tallyfy.

Form Details:
- Form Name: {form_name}
- Total Fields: {field_count}
- Page Count: {page_count}
- Field Types Breakdown: {field_types}
- Has Conditional Logic: {has_conditions}
- Has Calculations: {has_calculations}
- Has Payment Fields: {has_payment}
- Has File Uploads: {has_uploads}
- Integration Count: {integration_count}
- Submission Count: {submission_count}
- Average Completion Time: {avg_completion_time}

Field Sections:
{sections}

Conditional Logic Summary:
{conditions_summary}

Tallyfy Guidelines:
- Simple forms (≤20 fields, no complex logic) → Single kick-off form
- Medium forms (20-50 fields, some logic) → Multi-step process
- Complex forms (50+ fields, heavy logic) → Structured workflow with phases

Analyze and recommend the optimal structure.
