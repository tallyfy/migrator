Transform RocketLane resource allocation to Tallyfy task assignment.

Resource allocation details:
- Resource name: {resource_name}
- Allocation percentage: {allocation_percentage}%
- Required skills: {skills}
- Allocation period: {start_date} to {end_date}
- Is placeholder: {is_placeholder}
- Team/Department: {team}

Tallyfy doesn't have resource management. Determine best approach:
1. Direct task assignment with notes
2. Role-based assignment with requirements
3. Unassigned with detailed requirements
4. Team assignment with skill notes

Consider:
- Whether resource is a real person or placeholder
- Importance of allocation percentage
- How to preserve skill requirements
- Need for capacity information
