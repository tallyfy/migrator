Determine how to handle RocketLane time tracking data in Tallyfy migration.

Time tracking details:
- Has billing integration: {has_billing}
- Total hours logged: {total_hours_logged}
- Tracking frequency: {tracking_frequency} (high/medium/low)
- Users tracking time: {user_count}
- Time categories used: {time_categories}
- Links to invoicing: {links_to_invoicing}
- Average hours per task: {avg_hours_per_task}

Tallyfy doesn't have native time tracking. Determine strategy:
1. "external_integration" - Integrate with external time tracking tool
2. "structured_comments" - Add time as structured comments on tasks
3. "task_comments" - Simple time notation in regular comments
4. "summary_only" - Add summary time to process completion
5. "skip" - Don't migrate time data

Consider:
- Importance of time data for billing
- Volume of time entries
- Need for reporting
- User expectations
