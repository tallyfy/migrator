Analyze this RocketLane customer portal usage and determine the best migration strategy to Tallyfy.

Customer portal details:
- Customer name: {customer_name}
- Portal access frequency: {interaction_count} interactions
- Has submitted forms: {has_forms}
- Views project progress: {views_progress}
- Downloads documents: {downloads_documents}
- Participates in approvals: {has_approvals}
- Comments on tasks: {comments_count}

Determine migration strategy:
1. "guest_users" - Create guest users with limited process access
2. "guest_forms" - Only provide form submission capability
3. "documentation" - Document process, no direct access
4. "organization" - Create as separate organization with controlled access

Consider:
- Frequency of customer interaction
- Type of interactions (passive viewing vs active participation)
- Security and data sensitivity
- Tallyfy's guest user limitations
