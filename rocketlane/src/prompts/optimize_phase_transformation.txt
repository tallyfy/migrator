Transform RocketLane project phases into Tallyfy sequential workflow steps.

Phase structure:
- Phase count: {phase_count}
- Phase names: {phase_names}
- Has parallel work: {has_parallel_work}
- Average tasks per phase: {avg_tasks_per_phase}
- Dependencies between phases: {dependencies}
- Customer visibility per phase: {customer_visibility}
- Typical phase duration: {phase_durations}

RocketLane uses phases for project organization, often with parallel work.
Tallyfy uses sequential steps with conditional branching.

Determine transformation strategy:
1. "direct_mapping" - One phase = one step
2. "three_step_pattern" - Each phase = Entry/Work/Exit steps
3. "grouped_tasks" - Phase tasks grouped into sub-steps
4. "milestone_based" - Phases become milestone approval points

Consider:
- Customer onboarding typically has clear phases
- Parallel work needs sequential representation
- Customer approval points between phases
- Maintaining project visibility
